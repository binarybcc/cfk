                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        Christmas for Kids connects generous community members with local families who need 
                        extra support during the holiday season. We believe every child deserves to wake up 
                        on Christmas morning with gifts to unwrap and the knowledge that someone cares about them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our approach is built on dignity and respect. Families aren't charity cases - they're 
                        our neighbors going through temporary difficult times. We work to maintain family 
                        connections while providing the Christmas magic every child deserves.
                    </p>
