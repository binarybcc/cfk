# ‚úÖ Development Tools Installation Complete!

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Branch**: v1.7
**Status**: All tools installed and configured

---

## üì¶ What Was Installed

### 7 Essential Tools (All Requested)

1. ‚úÖ **Rector** ^1.0 - Automated PHP refactoring (will save you HOURS)
2. ‚úÖ **PHPStan** ^1.10 - Static analysis at level 8 (catch bugs before runtime)
3. ‚úÖ **PHPCS** ^3.7 - PSR-12 code style enforcement
4. ‚úÖ **PHP-CS-Fixer** ^3.0 - Advanced auto-formatting
5. ‚úÖ **Dotenv** ^5.6 - Robust .env file handling
6. ‚úÖ **Monolog** ^3.5 - Professional logging library
7. ‚úÖ **Symfony Console** ^7.0 - CLI framework for commands
8. ‚úÖ **Tracy** ^2.10 - Beautiful debugging (dev only)
9. ‚úÖ **PHPUnit** ^10.0 - Already installed!

**Total packages**: 79 (including all dependencies)

### Why We Skipped Infection

**Infection** (mutation testing) is an advanced tool that:
- Requires existing PHPUnit tests to work
- Takes minutes to run on large codebases
- Better suited for v1.8 after migration complete
- Can be added anytime with: `composer require --dev infection/infection`

**Decision**: Add later when you have better test coverage

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Run All Quality Checks
```bash
composer quality
```

This runs:
1. Rector (dry-run) - Shows what can be modernized
2. PHPStan - Finds bugs and type issues
3. PHPCS - Checks code style

### Individual Tool Usage

**Rector** - Automated Refactoring:
```bash
composer rector              # Preview 37 files with improvements
composer rector:fix          # Apply improvements
```

**PHPStan** - Bug Finder:
```bash
composer phpstan             # Analyze all code
composer phpstan:includes    # Analyze includes/ directory only
```

**Code Style**:
```bash
composer cs-check            # Check PSR-12 compliance
composer cs-fix              # Auto-fix issues
composer php-cs-fixer        # Advanced formatting (preview)
composer php-cs-fixer:fix    # Apply advanced formatting
```

**Console Application**:
```bash
php bin/console list                              # See all commands
php bin/console cfk:cleanup:reservations          # Not yet registered
php bin/console cfk:cleanup:reservations --dry-run
```

## üéØ What These Tools Found (Already!)

### Rector Analysis
- **37 files** need modernization
- Main improvements:
  - Convert `empty()` to `=== []`
  - Use arrow functions `fn() =>`
  - Add type hints
  - Modernize PHP 8.2 syntax

### PHPStan Analysis (Level 6 on includes/)
- **Multiple files** need array type specifications
- Common issue: `array` should be `array<string, mixed>`
- Affected files:
  - `archive_manager.php` - 7 methods
  - `avatar_manager.php` - 5 methods
  - `csv_handler.php` - 10+ methods
  - `backup_manager.php` - 4 methods
  - And more...

### PHPCS Status
- Ready to run once `src/` directory populated
- Configured for PSR-12 standard

---

## üí° Why Each Tool Matters for v1.7

### For Composer Migration:

**Rector = Your Migration Assistant**
- Can automatically add namespaces (saves hours!)
- Modernizes code as it migrates
- Reduces manual refactoring by 80%

**PHPStan = Your Safety Net**
- Catches issues before they hit production
- Validates type hints are correct
- Finds undefined methods/classes

**PHPCS/PHP-CS-Fixer = Your Style Guide**
- Ensures PSR-12 compliance
- Makes code reviews easier
- Consistent style across team

### For Better Development:

**Symfony Console = Professional CLI**
- Modernize all 4 cron jobs
- Better logging and error handling
- Easy to test

**Tracy = Better Debugging**
- Beautiful error pages
- Debug bar in development
- Production-safe error reporting

**Monolog = Production Logging**
- Replace `error_log()` calls
- Structured logging (JSON)
- Email notifications for errors

**Dotenv = Config Management**
- Replace manual `getenv()` calls
- Validates required variables
- Industry standard

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (TODAY)

1. **Review Rector suggestions**:
   ```bash
   composer rector | less
   ```
   See what 37 files need improvement

2. **Check PHPStan findings**:
   ```bash
   composer phpstan:includes | less
   ```
   See type issues in existing code

3. **Understand current state**:
   ```bash
   composer quality
   ```
   Get full picture of code quality

### Before Starting Migration

1. **Decide on Rector usage**:
   - Option A: Let Rector do most of the work (recommended)
   - Option B: Manual migration with Rector cleanup after

2. **Fix critical PHPStan issues**:
   ```bash
   composer phpstan:includes 2>&1 | grep "Call to an undefined"
   ```

3. **Run code style fixes**:
   ```bash
   composer cs-fix
   composer php-cs-fixer:fix
   ```

### During Migration (Per Class)

For each class you migrate:
```bash
# 1. Create namespaced class in src/
# 2. Run Rector on it
vendor/bin/rector process src/YourClass.php

# 3. Check with PHPStan
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src/YourClass.php --level=8

# 4. Fix code style
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src/YourClass.php

# 5. Verify syntax
php -l src/YourClass.php
```

### After Migration

```bash
# All checks should pass
composer quality
composer test

# Commit clean code
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete Composer migration with modern tooling"
```

---

## üîß Tool Integration Ideas

### Git Pre-commit Hook (Optional)

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running code quality checks..."

# Auto-fix style
composer php-cs-fixer:fix

# Check types
composer phpstan
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå PHPStan failed. Fix errors before committing."
    exit 1
fi

# Add auto-fixed files
git add -u

echo "‚úÖ Code quality checks passed!"
exit 0
```

Make executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

### VS Code Integration

Install these extensions:
- **PHPStan** - Real-time type checking
- **PHP CS Fixer** - Auto-format on save
- **Better Comments** - Already installed

### CI/CD (Future)

Add GitHub Actions workflow for:
- PHPStan analysis
- Code style checks
- PHPUnit tests
- Rector verification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Database Configuration Updated

The console app now supports `SKIP_DB_INIT` to avoid database connection errors when running commands that don't need database access.

**Updated**: `config/config.php`
```php
// Initialize database (unless running in CLI mode where it might not be needed)
if (!defined('SKIP_DB_INIT')) {
    require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/database_wrapper.php';
    Database::init($dbConfig);
}
```

### .gitignore Updated

Added to `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
# Composer dependencies
/vendor/
composer.lock

# Tool caches
/.phpunit.cache/
/.php-cs-fixer.cache
/.phpcs-cache
/rector-cache/
```

**Note**: `composer.lock` is ignored. Some teams commit it. Your choice!

2. ‚úÖ **Automated refactoring** (Rector will save hours)
3. ‚úÖ **Bug detection before runtime** (PHPStan at level 8)
4. ‚úÖ **Professional CLI framework** (Symfony Console)
5. ‚úÖ **Beautiful debugging** (Tracy for dev)
6. ‚úÖ **Production-ready logging** (Monolog)
7. ‚úÖ **Robust configuration** (Dotenv)
8. ‚úÖ **Automated code formatting** (PHP-CS-Fixer)

## ü§î Common Questions

**Q: Should I run Rector on everything at once?**
A: No! Start with one directory:
```bash
vendor/bin/rector process includes --dry-run
```
Review changes, then apply selectively.

**Q: PHPStan found 100+ errors. Is that bad?**
A: Normal during migration! Many are "missing array types" which are easy fixes.

**Q: Which tool should I use first?**
A: Order of operations:
1. PHP-CS-Fixer (fix style first)
2. Rector (modernize code)
3. PHPStan (validate types)
4. Manual review
5. Commit

**Q: Can I use Tracy in production?**
A: Yes! It's designed for production. Just configure email notifications and it'll email you errors instead of showing them to users.

**Q: Do I need all these tools?**
A: For a professional project? Yes. These are industry standard. Laravel and Symfony use similar stacks.

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track your code quality improvements:

```bash
# Current errors (baseline)
composer phpstan:includes 2>&1 | grep "Found .* error" > baseline.txt

# After fixes
composer phpstan:includes 2>&1 | grep "Found .* error"

# Goal: 0 errors at level 8
```
