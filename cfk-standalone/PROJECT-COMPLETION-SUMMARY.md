## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Passwordless Sponsor Portal**: Token-based authentication avoids password management overhead
2. **Email-First Approach**: Complete shopping information in email ensures sponsors have details offline
3. **Transaction Safety**: Critical operations wrapped in database transactions
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between public pages, admin functions, and core logic

### Security Implementations
1. **Multiple Layers**: CSRF + input validation + output escaping + parameterized queries
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Admin-only access by default, public access explicitly granted
3. **Audit Trail**: Email log tracks all communications for troubleshooting
4. **Backup-First**: Year-end reset creates backups BEFORE any deletion

### User Experience Design
1. **Print-Friendly Emails**: Sponsors can print and take shopping
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information prominently displayed
3. **Clear Feedback**: Success/error messages on all actions
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, mobile
