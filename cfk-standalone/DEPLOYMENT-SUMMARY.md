## 🔄 The New Workflow

### **Before (Confusing):**
```
1. Upload file
2. Check "update existing"? (what does that mean?)
3. Check "dry run"? (do I want that?)
4. Import
5. If dry run, upload again without it
6. Hope sponsored children weren't lost
```

### **After (Simple):**
```
1. Upload your complete children CSV
   ↓ (automatic backup created)
2. Review preview and warnings
   ↓ (sponsored children shown if removed)
3. Click "Confirm Import"
   ↓ (sponsorships automatically preserved)
4. Done!
```

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### **Architecture:**

**Session-Based Upload:**
- Temp file stored in `/tmp/cfk_uploads/` with session ID
- Persists between preview and confirm steps
- Automatic cleanup after import

**Database Operations:**
- Sponsorship lookup by `family_id + child_letter`
- Status preservation for matching children
- Optional inactive child retention

**Backup System:**
- Rolling 2-backup limit with automatic cleanup
- Metadata JSON includes counts and timestamps
- Pre-restore safety backup created

**Error Handling:**
- Try-catch blocks throughout
- Detailed error logging via error_log()
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation

### **Security:**

✅ CSRF token verification
✅ File type validation (CSV only)
✅ File size limit (5MB)
✅ Session-based security
✅ Temp directory permissions (0700)
✅ Direct access prevention

### **Code Quality:**

✅ PHP 8.1+ modern syntax (array destructuring)
✅ Strict type declarations
✅ Proper error handling
✅ Clean separation of concerns
✅ Comprehensive comments
✅ No syntax errors

## 🧪 Next Steps - Manual Testing

Since this is a production deployment, you should manually test:

### **Critical Tests (Do These First):**

1. **Upload a Valid CSV**
   - Visit: https://cforkids.org/admin/import_csv.php
   - Upload your actual children CSV
   - Verify preview shows correct statistics
   - Confirm warnings make sense
   - Click "Confirm Import"
   - Verify success message

2. **Verify Sponsorship Preservation**
   - Note which children are sponsored before import
   - Import CSV with those children
   - Check database after import
   - Confirm sponsored status preserved

3. **Test Backup System**
   - Scroll to "Backup Management" section
   - Verify backup was created with timestamp
   - Note the children count in metadata
   - Optionally test restore functionality

4. **Check Warning System**
   - Try uploading CSV missing a sponsored child
   - Verify RED warning appears
   - Check "Keep inactive children" option
   - Confirm it works as expected

### **Secondary Tests:**

5. Download a backup file (should be valid CSV)
6. Upload malformed CSV (verify error handling)
7. Test session timeout (wait, then try to confirm)
8. Verify frontend shows updated children
