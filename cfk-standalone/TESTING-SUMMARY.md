## üîß Tools Needed for Full Automation (Optional)

To achieve 90%+ test automation, install:

```bash
npm install --save-dev puppeteer
```

This would enable automated testing of:
- Admin login and navigation
- CSV download and validation
- Interactive elements (search, filters)
- Visual regression testing
- JavaScript error detection

See `docs/testing/automated-testing-capabilities.md` for details.

## üßπ Cleanup When Testing Complete

```bash
# Upload and run cleanup script
sshpass -p 'PASSWORD' ssh -p 22 user@server \
  "mysql -u USER -pPASS DB < /path/cleanup_test_data.sql"
```

This will:
1. Show counts before deletion
2. Remove all TEST-marked data
3. Show counts after deletion
4. Verify real data is intact
