# Christmas for Kids - Standalone Sponsorship System

A dignified, maintainable PHP application for managing child sponsorship programs. Built to replace WooCommerce-based systems with a respectful, user-focused approach.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Respectful Approach**: Children are individuals seeking support, not products
- **Gift-Delivery Model**: Sponsors buy and deliver physical gifts, not monetary donations
- **Non-Coder Maintainable**: Simple PHP with clear documentation
- **Visitor-Focused UX**: Easy browsing, search, and sponsorship process
- **Complete Shopping Info**: Sponsors receive detailed email with sizes, wishes, interests
- **Nexcess Compatible**: Pure PHP without framework conflicts

5. Sponsor purchases gifts and delivers unwrapped to CFK

- Receive updated comprehensive email with all children
