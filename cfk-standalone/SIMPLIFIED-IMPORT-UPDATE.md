# Simplified CSV Import - Deployment Summary

## ✅ Files Created/Updated

### New Files:
1. **includes/import_analyzer.php** - Analyzes CSV changes and detects warnings
   - Compares new vs current children
   - Detects sponsored children being removed
   - Warns about data loss
   - Preserves sponsorship status on import

### Updated Files:
1. **includes/csv_handler.php** - Added `parseCSVForPreview()` method
2. **admin/import_csv.php** - Complete two-step workflow:
   - `handlePreviewImport()` - Step 1: Upload & analyze
   - `handleConfirmImport()` - Step 2: Apply changes

## 🔄 New Workflow

### Step 1: Upload & Preview (Automatic)
- User uploads CSV file
- System saves to temp location
- Parses and analyzes changes
- Shows preview with warnings

### Step 2: Confirm Import
- User reviews changes
- Decides on warnings (keep/remove inactive)
- Clicks "Confirm Import"
- System applies changes

## ⚠️ Smart Warnings

### High Priority:
- Sponsored children being removed
- Pending selections being removed

### Medium Priority:
- Data becoming blank (was filled, now empty)
- Age decreased (likely error)

### Low Priority:
- Gender changed

## 🔒 Sponsorship Preservation

Automatically preserves:
- Sponsorship status (sponsored/pending)
- Sponsorship records in database
- Selection history

## 📝 UI Changes Needed

The HTML form needs to be updated to:
1. Change action from "import_csv" to "preview_import"
2. Remove "dry_run" checkbox (always previews first)
3. Remove "update_existing" checkbox (always updates)
4. Add preview results section with warnings
5. Add "Confirm Import" button that appears after preview

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Update HTML form in import_csv.php (lines ~879-920)
2. Add preview results display section
3. Upload all files to server
4. Test the workflow

## 📊 Expected User Experience

**Simple Case (no warnings):**
1. Upload file → See "45 children will be imported" → Click Confirm → Done

**Complex Case (warnings):**
1. Upload file → See warnings about sponsored kids → Choose to keep inactive → Confirm → Done

**Error Case:**
1. Upload file → See errors → Fix CSV → Upload again
