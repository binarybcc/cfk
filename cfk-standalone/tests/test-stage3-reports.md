- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS protection (proper escaping in templates)

### CSV Export Security
- ✅ Proper headers prevent code injection
- ✅ Data validated before export
- ✅ No direct SQL in export functions

## Browser Compatibility ✅

Tested on:
- ✅ Chrome 118+ (primary test browser)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- Modern browser features used appropriately

## Known Limitations

1. **PDF Export**: Not implemented (CSV only for now)
2. **Pagination**: Not needed yet due to low data volume
3. **Advanced Filters**: Basic filters only (can be extended)
4. **Real-time Updates**: Page refresh required
5. **Print Styling**: Could be optimized for physical printing
