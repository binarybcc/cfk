# Docker Removed - Functional Tests Disabled

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Reason:** Switched to staging-only testing approach

---

## What Changed

Docker containers and environment have been completely removed from this project.

**Removed:**
- All Docker containers (cfk-web, cfk-mysql, cfk-phpmyadmin)
- Docker volumes
- Docker-compose setup

**Replaced with:**
- Staging environment testing: https://10ce79bd48.nxcli.io/
- Manual verification on staging server
- PHPStan static analysis for local checks

---

## Impact on Testing

### ⚠️ Functional Test Script No Longer Works

The `security-functional-tests.sh` script relied heavily on Docker and will **NOT work** without modification.

**Script dependencies that are broken:**
- Line 109: `docker exec cfk-web` - Admin link checking
- Line 168: `docker exec cfk-web` - Rate limiter tests
- Line 186: `docker exec cfk-web` - Database connection tests
- Line 217: `docker exec cfk-mysql` - Database table checks
- Line 255: `docker exec cfk-web` - Session configuration
- Line 279: `docker exec cfk-web` - Environment file checks
- Line 306: `docker exec cfk-web` - Hardcoded credential checks

### New Testing Approach

**Local testing (before deployment):**
```bash
# Static analysis only
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse admin/ includes/ pages/ cron/ src/ --level 6
```

**Integration testing:**
1. Deploy to staging: `/deploy-staging`
2. Manual verification: https://10ce79bd48.nxcli.io/
3. Test all changed functionality
4. Verify no regressions

**Production deployment:**
1. Test on staging first (always)
2. Get user approval
3. Deploy to production: `/deploy-production`
4. Verify on production

## Why Docker Was Removed

Per user request: "Let's stop using docker on this project. We will either work from the local folder or from staging (for testing)."

This simplifies the workflow:
- ✅ No Docker maintenance
- ✅ No local environment setup
- ✅ Testing matches actual server environment (staging)
- ✅ Faster iteration (edit locally, test on staging)

---

## Future Considerations

If functional testing needs to be restored:

**Option 1: Rewrite tests for staging**
- Use SSH/curl to test staging environment
- Adapt tests to run against https://10ce79bd48.nxcli.io/

**Option 2: Manual test checklist**
- Create checklist of critical functionality
- Manual verification on staging before production

**Option 3: Re-enable Docker (not recommended)**
- Would require user approval
- Goes against simplified workflow

---

**Current recommendation:** Manual testing on staging is sufficient for this project's needs.
