## 🎯 3 Decisions You Need to Make

### Decision 1: What's Next?

**Option A**: Continue migrations (Archive → Sponsorship → CSV)
**Option B**: Test current state in Docker first
**Option C**: Set up integration layer

**My Recommendation**: Option A (momentum!)

### Decision 2: Old Files?

**Option A**: Delete old `includes/` files immediately
**Option B**: Keep both until testing complete ✅ (recommended)
**Option C**: Move to `includes/legacy/`

### Decision 3: Cron Jobs?

**Option A**: Migrate to Symfony Console commands ✅ (modern)
**Option B**: Keep as PHP scripts, update references
**Option C**: Both

---

## 🚀 What Happens Next?

### If you say "continue":

I'll immediately migrate these 3 classes:

1. **Archive Manager** (30 min)
   - Quick win - you already fixed env variables!
   - Just needs namespace + type hints

2. **Sponsorship Manager** (1 hour)
   - Most critical business logic
   - Preserve all reservation functionality

3. **CSV Handler** (1 hour)
   - Most complex (29 PHPStan issues)
   - Good learning experience

**Result**: 4 of 10 classes done (40% of Phase 2)

### If you say "test first":

I'll update `config/config.php` to:
- Load Composer autoloader
- Create compatibility alias for `Database`
- Allow both old and new class names

**Result**: Can test incrementally without breaking anything

## ❓ Questions?

**"How do I test the new Database class?"**
→ Update `config/config.php` and add class_alias (I can do this)

**"What if something breaks?"**
→ We kept old files, easy to rollback

**"Can I use the tools now?"**
→ Yes! Run `composer quality` to see

**"What's the quickest win?"**
→ Archive Manager - 30 minutes

**"What's the most important?"**
→ Sponsorship Manager - core business logic
