---

### **Test 5: Sponsor Portal Access (CRITICAL)**

#### Setup:
```bash
# Generate access token for test sponsor
docker-compose exec db mysql -u cfk_user -pcfk_pass cfk_sponsorship_dev -e \
  "INSERT INTO portal_access_tokens (email, token, expires_at, created_at) \
   VALUES ('test@example.com', 'test-token-12345', DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR), NOW());"
```

#### Steps:
1. Reset sponsorship to CONFIRMED:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db mysql -u cfk_user -pcfk_pass cfk_sponsorship_dev -e \
     "UPDATE sponsorships SET status = 'confirmed', completion_date = NULL WHERE id = 4;"
   ```

2. Access My Sponsorships with CONFIRMED status:
   ```
   http://localhost:8082/?page=my_sponsorships&token=test-token-12345
   ```

3. Mark as LOGGED in admin panel

4. Access My Sponsorships again with LOGGED status (same URL)

  "UPDATE sponsorships SET status = 'completed', completion_date = NOW() WHERE id = 4;"
```

- ‚ùå Should NOT display on My Sponsorships page
- ‚úÖ Shows "No sponsorships found" message

### **Test 6: Statistics Accuracy**

#### Steps:
1. Create multiple sponsorships in different statuses
2. Check statistics cards on admin dashboard

#### Database Setup:
```bash
# Create sponsorships in various states
docker-compose exec db mysql -u cfk_user -pcfk_pass cfk_sponsorship_dev << 'EOF'
-- Add a confirmed sponsorship
INSERT INTO sponsorships (child_id, sponsor_name, sponsor_email, sponsor_phone, sponsor_address, gift_preference, status, request_date, confirmation_date)
VALUES (1866, 'Sponsor Two', 'sponsor2@example.com', '555-2222', '456 Test Ave', 'gift_card', 'confirmed', NOW(), NOW());

-- Add a logged sponsorship
INSERT INTO sponsorships (child_id, sponsor_name, sponsor_email, sponsor_phone, sponsor_address, gift_preference, status, request_date, confirmation_date, logged_date)
VALUES (1867, 'Sponsor Three', 'sponsor3@example.com', '555-3333', '789 Test Blvd', 'cash_donation', 'logged', NOW(), NOW(), NOW());

-- Update children status
UPDATE children SET status = 'sponsored' WHERE id IN (1866, 1867);
EOF
```

#### Expected Statistics:

   SELECT id, status FROM children WHERE id = 1865;"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Mark Logged" button not appearing
**Check:**
```bash
# Verify code is loaded
curl -s http://localhost:8082/admin/manage_sponsorships.php | grep "Mark Logged"
```

### Issue: Sponsor cannot access portal when LOGGED
**Check:**
```bash
# Verify query includes 'logged' status
docker-compose exec db mysql -u cfk_user -pcfk_pass cfk_sponsorship_dev -e \
  "SELECT * FROM sponsorships WHERE sponsor_email = 'test@example.com' AND status IN ('confirmed', 'logged');"
```

### Issue: Statistics not updating
**Check:**
```bash
# Verify getStats() includes logged count
docker-compose exec db mysql -u cfk_user -pcfk_pass cfk_sponsorship_dev -e \
  "SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM sponsorships GROUP BY status;"
```
