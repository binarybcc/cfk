<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.14.1/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Create Test Page
Create `tests/alpine-test-page.php`:
```php
<?php require_once '../config/config.php'; ?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Alpine.js Test</title>
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.14.1/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div x-data="{ count: 0 }">
        <button @click="count++">Click me!</button>
        <p>Clicked <span x-text="count"></span> times</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Visit test page to verify Alpine.js loads correctly.

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Will this break existing functionality?**
A: No. All existing PHP code continues working. Alpine.js only enhances the experience.

**Q: What if JavaScript is disabled?**
A: Everything still works, just without the enhanced interactivity.

**Q: Do we need to change servers?**
A: No. Alpine.js is just JavaScript that runs in the browser.

**Q: How much slower will the site be?**
A: Alpine.js adds only ~0.1 seconds to initial page load. After that, it makes things faster (no page reloads).

**Q: Can we roll back if there are issues?**
A: Yes. Just remove the Alpine.js script tag from the header.

**Q: How is this different from v2.0?**
A: v1.4 is focused on Alpine.js only. v2.0 includes bigger features (Google Sheets, SMS, multi-language, Supply Hub).
