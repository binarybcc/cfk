---

## 🚀 Feature Roadmap

### 1. Google Sheets Integration

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies:** Google Workspace API access (confirmed available)

#### Background
Currently, child data is managed via CSV export/import with manual two-step workflow. Google Sheets integration would enable:
- Real-time or scheduled data synchronization
- Reduced manual data entry
- Multi-user collaborative editing
- Automatic backup and version history

#### Implementation Options

##### Option A: Manual Export/Upload (Current - v1.0)
**Status:** ✅ Currently implemented
**Process:**
1. Export Google Sheet as CSV
2. Upload via admin interface
3. Preview changes
4. Confirm import

**Pros:**
- Already working
- Simple and reliable
- No API dependencies
- Full control over when data syncs

**Cons:**
- Manual process required
- Potential for human error
- No real-time updates

##### Option B: Google Sheets API Direct Integration
**Status:** 🔄 Planned for v2.0
**Recommended Approach:** Service Account Authentication

**Technical Requirements:**
1. **Google Cloud Project Setup**
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create service account credentials
   - Download JSON key file

2. **Google Sheet Configuration**
   - Share sheet with service account email (e.g., `cfk-importer@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
   - Set read-only permissions for service account

3. **PHP Implementation**
   - Install Google API PHP Client: `composer require google/apiclient:"^2.15"`
   - Create `includes/google_sheets_api.php` handler
   - Build sync interface in admin panel

**Process Flow:**
1. Admin clicks "Sync from Google Sheets"
2. System fetches data via API
3. Preview changes (same as current import)
4. Admin confirms
5. Database updated with automatic backup

**Pros:**
- On-demand sync without file downloads
- Maintains current preview/confirm workflow
- Service account = no OAuth prompts
- Audit trail of who initiated sync

**Cons:**
- Requires Google Cloud project setup
- Dependency on external API
- Need to secure JSON key file

**Security Considerations:**
- Store service account JSON outside web root
- Set restrictive file permissions (0600)
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Implement rate limiting on API calls

##### Option C: Scheduled Automatic Sync
**Status:** 🔮 Future consideration (v2.1+)
**Requirements:**
- Option B (API integration) completed first
- Cron job or scheduled task setup

**Process:**
1. Nightly cron job runs sync script
2. Fetches latest data from Google Sheets
3. Compares with database
4. Auto-imports if no conflicts detected
5. Emails admin with sync report

**Pros:**
- Zero manual intervention
- Always up-to-date data
- Can run during off-hours

**Cons:**
- Less control over when changes apply
- Potential for unexpected changes
- Need robust conflict detection
- Requires monitoring and alerting

#### Recommended Implementation Path

**Phase 1 (v2.0):** Implement Option B (API Direct Integration)
- Maintains admin control with preview/confirm
- Reduces manual CSV export/upload steps
- Foundation for future automation
- Estimated timeline: 2-3 weeks

**Phase 2 (v2.1):** Consider Option C (Scheduled Sync)
- Only after Option B proven stable
- Requires additional conflict resolution logic
- Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks (after Phase 1)

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations

### Google Sheets API Implementation Details

#### Service Account Setup Steps
```bash
# 1. Install Google API PHP Client
composer require google/apiclient:"^2.15"

# 2. Store credentials securely
# Place JSON key at: /home/a4409d26_1/google-sheets-credentials.json
# Set permissions: chmod 0600 google-sheets-credentials.json
```

#### Sample Code Structure
```php
// includes/google_sheets_api.php
class GoogleSheetsSync {
    private $client;
    private $service;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->client = new Google_Client();
        $this->client->setAuthConfig('/path/to/credentials.json');
        $this->client->addScope(Google_Service_Sheets::SPREADSHEETS_READONLY);
        $this->service = new Google_Service_Sheets($this->client);
    }

    public function fetchChildrenData($spreadsheetId, $range = 'Sheet1!A:Z') {
        $response = $this->service->spreadsheets_values->get($spreadsheetId, $range);
        return $response->getValues();
    }

    public function convertToImportFormat($rawData) {
        // Transform Google Sheets data to match current CSV format
        // Returns array matching existing import structure
    }
}
```

#### Admin Interface Addition
```php
// admin/sync_google_sheets.php
// New page similar to import_csv.php but:
// 1. Fetches data via API instead of file upload
// 2. Uses existing preview/confirm workflow
// 3. Leverages backup_manager.php and import_analyzer.php
```

### Database Schema Updates
No database changes required for Google Sheets integration - uses existing import workflow.

### Configuration Updates
```php
// config/config.php additions for v2.0
'google_sheets' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'spreadsheet_id' => '1abc...xyz',  // From sheet URL
    'sheet_range' => 'Children!A:Z',
    'credentials_path' => '/home/a4409d26_1/google-sheets-credentials.json',
    'auto_sync' => false,  // Enable in v2.1
    'sync_schedule' => '0 2 * * *'  // 2 AM daily (future)
],
```
