- **Simple** - Two-step preview-then-confirm workflow

---

## 📦 Files Deployed

### ✅ New Files Created:
1. **`/includes/import_analyzer.php`** (8.5 KB)
   - Analyzes CSV changes vs current database

   - Download backup files

### ✅ Updated Files:
3. **`/includes/csv_handler.php`**
   - Added `parseCSVForPreview()` method
   - Parses CSV without importing for analysis

4. **`/admin/import_csv.php`**
   - Complete rewrite of upload workflow
   - Two-step process: preview → confirm
   - Session-based file handling (no re-upload)
   - Visual warning display by severity
   - Backup management interface

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Old Workflow** (Confusing):
```
1. Upload CSV
2. Check "update existing" or not?
3. Check "dry run" or not?
4. Click import
5. If dry run, re-upload without it
6. Hope you didn't lose sponsored children
```

### **New Workflow** (Simple):
```
1. Upload CSV file
   ↓ (automatic backup created)
2. See preview with statistics and warnings
   ↓ (sponsored children being removed? you'll know!)
3. Click "Confirm Import"
   ↓ (sponsorships automatically preserved)
4. Done!
```

## ⚠️ Smart Warnings System

### **High Priority** (Red):
- Sponsored children not in new upload
- Pending selections not in new upload

### **Medium Priority** (Orange):
- Data becoming blank (was filled, now empty)
- Age decreased (likely data entry error)

### **Low Priority** (Yellow):
- Gender changed (unusual but possible)

---

## 🔒 What Gets Preserved Automatically

**Sponsorship Status:**
- Children marked "sponsored" stay sponsored
- Children marked "pending" stay pending
- Matched by Family ID + Child Letter

**Example:**
```
Before import: Child "Maria" (Family 101A) - Status: sponsored
CSV upload: Child "Maria" (Family 101A) - Status: available
After import: Child "Maria" (Family 101A) - Status: sponsored ✅
```

---

## 💾 Automatic Backup System

**Before Every Import:**
- Full CSV export of current children data
- Saved with timestamp: `children_backup_2025-10-10_15-30-45_csv_import.csv`
- Metadata file includes counts and reason
- Automatic cleanup keeps only last 2 backups

**Restore:**
- One-click restore from backup list
- Option to keep or clear existing data
- Creates safety backup before restore

---

## 🎨 User Interface Improvements

### **Upload Section:**

- No confusing checkboxes

### **Preview Section:**
- Statistics cards (New/Updated/Removed/Unchanged)

4. **Check the warnings** to ensure they're helpful
5. **Report any issues** so we can refine the system
