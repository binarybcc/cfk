# Quick Guide: CSV Import System

## üì§ How to Upload Children

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File
- Keep ONE master CSV file with ALL children
- Update it as needed throughout the year
- Don't worry about removing sponsored children from the file
- Standard format: Family ID, Child Letter, Name, Age, Gender, etc.

### Step 2: Upload & Preview
1. Go to **Admin ‚Üí Import CSV** (https://cforkids.org/admin/import_csv.php)
2. Click "Choose File" and select your CSV
3. Click "Upload & Preview"
4. **Wait for preview** - shows what will change

### Step 3: Review Warnings
**Red Warnings (Important!):**
- Sponsored children not in new file
- You can choose to keep them as "inactive"

**Orange Warnings (Check These):**
- Data being cleared (was filled, now blank)
- Ages going down (probably a typo)

**Yellow Warnings (FYI):**
- Gender changes (unusual but OK)

### Step 4: Confirm Import
1. Choose whether to keep inactive sponsored children ‚òëÔ∏è
2. Click "Confirm Import"
3. Done! Sponsorships are automatically preserved

## üí° Pro Tips

**Maintaining Your CSV:**
1. Always work from ONE master file
2. Add new children to the end
3. Update existing children's info as needed
4. Don't delete sponsored children (system will warn you)

**Before Each Upload:**
1. Make sure ages increased (or stayed same)
2. Check that sponsored children are still in the file
3. Verify no important data is blank

**Using Warnings:**
- **High priority** = Stop and review
- **Medium priority** = Double-check your CSV
- **Low priority** = Probably OK, just confirming
