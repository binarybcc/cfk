## Common Sponsor Questions

### "Can I change which child I sponsor?"

**Answer**: Contact CFK administration directly. Sponsorships are confirmed to ensure fairness and prevent children from being unsponsored.

**Contact**: [CFK phone/email]

### "Can I sponsor an entire family?"

**Answer**: Yes! When browsing, click "Sponsor Entire Family" instead of individual child profiles. One form covers all siblings.

### "What if I can't shop in time?"

**Answer**: Contact CFK immediately. Options may include:
- Gift card delivery instead
- Cash donation for staff to shop
- Transfer to available sponsor

### "Can I contact the family directly?"

**Answer**: No. CFK coordinates all family communication to protect privacy and ensure appropriate interactions. All gifts delivered by CFK staff.

### "What if I lost the confirmation email?"

**Answer**: Use the Sponsor Portal (see above) to view your sponsorships again. Enter your email to receive secure access link.

### "Can I sponsor the same child next year?"

**Answer**: Possibly! Contact CFK administration in the fall. Child availability changes each year based on need.

### "Do I get a thank you note?"

**Answer**: Depends on organization policy. Some families send cards through CFK. Focus is on making child's Christmas special, not recognition.

### "Is this tax-deductible?"

**Answer**: Contact CFK about donation receipts. Gift purchases typically not deductible, but cash donations may be.

### "Can I see photos of gift delivery?"

**Answer**: Organization policy varies. Privacy of families is priority. Some organizations share general photos (no identifying info).
