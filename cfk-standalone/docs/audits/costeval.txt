You are acting as a senior software project manager and technical documentation specialist.  
Using the **actual cforkids.org website**, its **source code**, **development notes**, and any project documentation or commit history available, generate a **comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW)** describing the real project as completed.

This SOW must reflect the actual architecture, tools, workflows, and deliverables — not generic estimates. The purpose is to document the real scope, effort, and cost range for presentation to stakeholders and potential funders.

---

### Include the Following Sections:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Summarize the cforkids.org platform: its purpose (child/family sponsorship), main user types, and goals (connect donors with families, streamline sponsorships, manage donor records, etc.).
   - Describe the system architecture and main technologies actually used (frontend stack, backend framework, CMS, database, hosting platform, payment gateway, APIs).
   - Note the project timeline (inception → launch) and current production status.

2. **Phased Breakdown (as actually executed)**
   Organize the real work performed into these standard software phases:
   - **Discovery & Planning:** research, requirements gathering, design brief, data modeling.
   - **Design:** UI/UX wireframes, visual themes, responsive layouts, accessibility.
   - **Build / Implementation:** actual coding of frontend, backend, CMS setup, payment integration, data imports, and configuration.
   - **Testing / QA:** describe real test coverage, browser/device testing, performance and security checks.
   - **Launch & Handoff:** production deployment steps, DNS setup, hosting configuration, content load, and team training if applicable.

   For each phase, specify:
   - Actual work performed (key deliverables and tools)
   - Actual or estimated hours
   - Resources/roles involved (developer, designer, tester, PM, etc.)

3. **Estimate Table**
   Create a table summarizing realistic **Low / Medium / High** cost and effort ranges based on:
   - The real work done (actual effort = “Medium” baseline)
   - “Low” = accelerated AI-assisted workflow estimate
   - “High” = fully human-built equivalent

   Example:
   | Phase | Low Estimate (AI-accelerated) | Medium (Actual Project) | High (Full Human Equivalent) |
   |--------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
   | Discovery | $1,800 / 20h | $2,500 / 28h | $4,000 / 40h |
   | Design | ... | ... | ... |

4. **Resource Breakdown**
   Use your actual resource data or inferred roles (developer, AI tool, content creator, QA, PM).  
   Include typical hourly or equivalent cost rates for each.  
   Note where AI systems replaced or augmented human labor.

5. **AI Development Impact Section**
   - Explain specifically how AI tools were used in cforkids.org (e.g., code generation, UI design, text generation, integration support).
   - Quantify or describe time/cost savings.
   - Clarify which components were human-validated (security, UX testing, accessibility, etc.)
   - Evaluate maintainability and long-term sustainability of the AI-produced codebase.

6. **Deliverables Checklist**
   List every major deliverable actually produced:
   - Live website and domain setup
   - Source code repository
   - CMS configuration and admin panel
   - Payment integration (e.g., Stripe/PayPal)
   - Documentation / training materials
   - Analytics, SSL, backups, etc.

7. **Assumptions and Exclusions**
   Note what was not in scope (e.g., no mobile app, no CRM integration, no advanced donor analytics).

8. **Maintenance & Support Plan**
   - Document any ongoing maintenance processes, hosting costs, or AI automation for content updates.
   - Provide suggested monthly or annual support cost ranges.

9. **Executive Summary**
   - Provide a final paragraph summarizing total project cost range and impact.
   - Example: “The cforkids.org project was successfully delivered using a human-directed AI development model, achieving full donor-facing functionality at approximately 40–50% of traditional development cost, with strong scalability and maintainability.”

### Formatting Requirements:
- Use clear, professional SOW headings and subheadings.
- Include cost and time tables where possible.
- Write in a tone suitable for presentation to board members, donors, and technical reviewers.
- Avoid placeholders — base content on real project evidence wherever available.
- Output in structured Markdown or Word-compatible format.

---

### Optional Follow-up Prompts:
- “Now output a one-page executive summary version of this SOW for presentation to nontechnical stakeholders.”
- “Generate a cost and effort chart comparing AI-assisted vs traditional build.”
- “Add an appendix describing the code architecture and third-party integrations.”
