## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 1: Add Skip Link to Main Content (WCAG 2.4.1 Level A)

**Files Modified**:
- `includes/header.php` - Added skip link and main content ID
- `assets/css/styles.css` - Added skip link styles

**Implementation**:
```html
<!-- Skip link appears on keyboard focus only -->
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<!-- Main content landmark -->
<main id="main-content" class="main-content" tabindex="-1">
```

**CSS Features**:
- Hidden by default (top: -40px)
- Appears on focus (top: 0)
- High contrast yellow outline on focus
- Positioned at top-left when visible

**Benefits**:
- Keyboard users can bypass navigation
- Faster access to main content
- Reduced tab stops on every page

---

### ✅ Task 2: Fix All Form Labels (WCAG 3.3.2 Level A)

**Files Modified**:
- `includes/header.php` - Search form accessibility
- `pages/sponsor_lookup.php` - Email form ARIA attributes

**Findings**:
- ✓ Most forms already had proper labels
- ✓ Children filters already labeled correctly
- ✓ Sponsorship forms already labeled correctly

**Enhancements Added**:

**Header Search Form**:
```html
<label for="header-search-input" class="visually-hidden">Search for children</label>
<input type="text"
       id="header-search-input"
       name="search"
       aria-describedby="header-search-hint">
<span id="header-search-hint" class="visually-hidden">
    Search by family number, age, grade, or interests
</span>
<button type="submit" class="search-btn" aria-label="Submit search">Search</button>
```

**Sponsor Lookup Form**:
```html
<label for="sponsor_email" class="form-label">
    Your Email Address <span aria-label="required">*</span>
</label>
<input type="email"
       id="sponsor_email"
       name="sponsor_email"
       required
       aria-required="true"
       aria-describedby="email-help"
       autocomplete="email">
<div id="email-help" class="form-help">
    Enter the email address you used when sponsoring
</div>
```

**ARIA Attributes Added**:
- `aria-describedby` - Associates helper text with inputs
- `aria-required="true"` - Indicates required fields
- `aria-label` - Provides accessible names for buttons

**Benefits**:
- Screen readers announce field purpose
- Required fields are clearly indicated
- Helper text is programmatically linked
- Search hints are accessible

---

### ✅ Task 3: Add ARIA Live Regions (WCAG 4.1.3 Level AA)

**Files Modified**:
- `includes/header.php` - Added aria-live announcement region
- `assets/js/selections.js` - Added announcement functionality to all cart operations

**Implementation**:

**Live Region Container**:
```html
<!-- Hidden region for screen reader announcements -->
<div id="a11y-announcements"
     class="visually-hidden"
     aria-live="polite"
     aria-atomic="true"></div>
```

**JavaScript Announcement Function**:
```javascript
/**
 * Announce changes to screen readers (WCAG 4.1.3)
 */
announce(message) {
    const announcer = document.getElementById('a11y-announcements');
    if (announcer) {
        announcer.textContent = '';
        setTimeout(() => {
            announcer.textContent = message;
        }, 100);
    }
}
```

**Cart Operations with Announcements**:

| Operation | Announcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Add child** | "Added child 175A to your selections. You have 1 child selected." |
| **Child already selected** | "Child 175A is already in your selections." |
| **Add multiple** | "Added 3 children to your selections. You now have 5 total selected." |
| **Remove child** | "Removed child 175A from your selections. You have 2 children remaining." |
| **Clear all** | "All selections cleared. Your cart is now empty." |

**Benefits**:
- Screen readers announce cart changes immediately
- Users know when children are added/removed
- No silent failures
- Polite announcements don't interrupt current reading

### ✅ Task 4: Semantic HTML Audit - Heading Hierarchy (WCAG 1.3.1 Level A)

**Issues Found & Fixed**:

**Problem**: Two pages had incorrect heading hierarchy (h1 → h3, skipping h2)

**Files Modified**:
1. **pages/children.php** - Fixed 2 heading levels
   - Line 343: Changed h3 → h2 ("No Children Found")
   - Line 424: Changed h3 → h2 ("Family X" in modal)

2. **pages/confirm_sponsorship.php** - Fixed 2 heading levels
   - Line 39: Changed h3 → h2 ("Your Selections")
   - Line 62: Changed h3 → h2 ("Your Contact Information")

**Heading Hierarchy Audit Results**:

| Page | h1 Source | Hierarchy | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| home.php | Explicit | h1 → (content varies) | ✓ Correct |
| children.php | page_header component | h1 → h2 | ✅ Fixed |
| child.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 | ✓ Correct |
| about.php | page_header component | h1 → h2 → h3 | ✓ Correct |
| how_to_apply.php | page_header component | h1 → h2 → h3 | ✓ Correct |
| sponsor_lookup.php | page_header component | h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 | ✓ Correct |
| sponsor_portal.php | page_header component | h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 → h5 | ✓ Correct |
| my_sponsorships.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 | ✓ Correct |
| reservation_review.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 → h3 | ✓ Correct |
| reservation_success.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 | ✓ Correct |
| confirm_sponsorship.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 | ✅ Fixed |
| sponsor.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 | ✓ Correct |
| donate.php | Explicit | h1 → h2 → h3 | ✓ Correct |

**Semantic HTML Structure Verified**:
- ✓ All pages have exactly one h1
- ✓ Headings follow logical hierarchy (no level skipping)
- ✓ Landmarks already exist: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- ✓ page_header.php component provides consistent h1

**Benefits**:
- Screen readers can navigate by headings
- Logical document outline
- Improved SEO
- Better content structure understanding

### ✅ Task 5: Visually Hidden Utility Class (Accessibility Infrastructure)

**File Modified**: `assets/css/styles.css`

**Implementation**:
```css
/* Visually Hidden - Screen Reader Only Content */
.visually-hidden {
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    padding: 0;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
    white-space: nowrap;
    border-width: 0;
}

.visually-hidden:focus {
    position: static;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
    padding: inherit;
    margin: inherit;
    overflow: visible;
    clip: auto;
    white-space: normal;
}
```

**Usage Throughout Site**:
- Skip link (hidden until focused)
- Form labels (visually hidden but screen reader accessible)
- Helper text (descriptive text for screen readers)
- ARIA live region (announcements only)

**Benefits**:
- Content accessible to screen readers
- Maintains visual design
- Becomes visible on focus (keyboard navigation)
- Standard accessibility pattern

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- [ ] Tab to skip link - should appear on focus
- [ ] Activate skip link - should jump to main content
- [ ] Tab through forms - all inputs should have visible labels
- [ ] Navigate all pages - heading order makes logical sense

**Screen Reader Testing** (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS):
- [ ] Navigate by headings (H key) - proper hierarchy on all pages
- [ ] Add child to cart - announcement should be heard
- [ ] Remove child from cart - announcement should be heard
- [ ] Clear cart - announcement should be heard
- [ ] Search form - label and hint should be announced
- [ ] Sponsor lookup form - required field and helper text announced

**Automated Testing**:
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
- [ ] Run axe DevTools scan
- [ ] Run WAVE browser extension
- [ ] Check for WCAG violations

### Expected Lighthouse Scores
- **Before**: ~75-80 (estimated)
- **After Phase 1**: ~85-90 (estimated)
- **After Phase 2**: 95-100 (goal)
