# 🐛 Bug Report: Claude Dev Installer MCP Server Installation Failure

**Reporter**: User johncorbin  
**Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: MCP Server Installation Module  
**Installation Target**: macOS (Claude Code environment)  

---

## **📋 Executive Summary**

The `claude-dev-installer-package` executed successfully for directory structure and VSCode extensions but failed to install 4 out of 6 expected MCP servers. Only `flow-nexus` installed correctly from the expected list, while `firecrawl` was found active (not in expected list).

---

## **🎯 Expected vs. Actual Results**

### **✅ What Worked (100% Success Rate):**
- Directory structure creation (`~/docs/`, `~/src/`, `~/tests/`, etc.)
- VSCode extensions installation (Claude Code, GitLens, Python suite)
- Global configuration directory (`~/.claude-global/`)

### **❌ What Failed (67% Failure Rate):**

| MCP Server | Expected | Actual Status | Command That Should Have Worked |
|------------|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| `github` | ✅ | ❌ Missing | `claude mcp add github npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github` |
| `sequential-thinking` | ✅ | ❌ Missing | `claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` |
| `memory` | ✅ | ❌ Missing | `claude mcp add memory npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` |
| `filesystem` | ✅ | ❌ Missing | `claude mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem HOME_DIR` |
| `context7` | ✅ | ⚠️ Configured but failing | `claude mcp add context7 https://mcp.context7.com/sse --transport sse` |
| `flow-nexus` | ✅ | ✅ Working | `claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start` |

### **🔍 Unexpected Finding:**
- `firecrawl` MCP server is active and working but was **not in the installer's expected list**
- This suggests the system had pre-existing MCP configuration that the installer didn't account for

---

## **🔧 Technical Analysis**

### **Installation Script Execution Path:**
```bash
# From /Users/johncorbin/claude-dev-installer-package/install.sh
MCP_SERVERS=(
    "github:npx:@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"
    "sequential-thinking:npx:@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking" 
    "memory:npx:@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
    "filesystem:npx:@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem:HOME_DIR"
    "context7:https://mcp.context7.com/sse:SSE"
    "flow-nexus:npx:flow-nexus@latest:mcp:start"
)
```

### **Current System State:**
```bash
$ claude mcp list
firecrawl: env FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-440db3caa601405f83db7562de7fc954 npx -y firecrawl-mcp - ✓ Connected
context7: https://mcp.context7.com/sse  - ✗ Failed to connect
flow-nexus: npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start - ✓ Connected
```

### **Evidence of Installer Execution:**
- ✅ Directory structure exists (`~/.claude-global/`, `~/docs/`, etc.)
- ✅ VSCode extensions installed correctly
- ✅ Configuration files present (`~/.claude.json` shows usage history)
- ❌ Only 1 of 6 MCP servers actually working

## **🕵️ Probable Root Causes**

### **1. Silent Installation Failures**
**Hypothesis**: The `claude mcp add` commands failed silently without proper error reporting

**Evidence**:
- Installer script has error handling: `2>/dev/null` redirects that may hide failure messages
- Install script shows: `warn "⚠️ Failed to install $server_name (may already exist)"`
- This suggests the installer expected failures and continued anyway

### **2. NPM Package Installation Issues**
**Hypothesis**: The `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` packages failed to install or are not available

**Potential Issues**:
- Network connectivity during npm package downloads
- NPM registry availability for these specific packages
- Version compatibility issues with current Node.js version

### **3. Claude Configuration Conflicts**
**Hypothesis**: Pre-existing Claude configuration prevented new MCP server registration

**Evidence**:
- `firecrawl` MCP exists but wasn't in installer list (pre-existing config)
- Claude config shows 65+ startups, indicating established system
- May have conflicting or locked configuration preventing additions

### **4. Permission or Path Issues**
**Hypothesis**: The installer couldn't write to Claude's configuration locations

**Potential Issues**:
- macOS permission restrictions
- Claude configuration path assumptions incorrect
- Global vs. local configuration conflicts

## **🧪 Reproduction Steps**

**To reproduce this issue on the development system:**

1. **Prepare a clean test environment** (or document current state):
   ```bash
   claude mcp list > before_install.txt
   ls -la ~/.claude* >> before_install.txt
   ```

2. **Run the installer**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/claude-dev-installer-package
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Verify results**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp list > after_install.txt
   diff before_install.txt after_install.txt
   ```

4. **Check for error logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for installation logs
   # Check if installer created log files
   # Examine any error output that was suppressed
   ```

---

## **🔍 Debug Information Needed**

**For the development team to investigate:**

### **1. Installation Logs**
- Does the installer create log files?
- What error messages were suppressed by `2>/dev/null`?
- Did the NPM package installations succeed?

### **2. Claude MCP Configuration**
- Where does `claude mcp add` actually store configuration?
- Is there a difference between Claude Desktop and Claude Code MCP configs?
- Are there any configuration file locks or permission issues?

### **3. Package Availability**
- Are the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` packages actually published to NPM?
- Do they have version compatibility requirements?
- Are there any known issues with these packages on macOS?

### **4. Installation Script Logic**
- Does the script properly handle existing MCP configurations?
- Is the parsing logic for `MCP_SERVERS` array working correctly?
- Are there any assumptions about system state that don't match reality?

---

## **💡 Suggested Fixes**

### **1. Immediate Workaround**
```bash
# Manual installation of missing MCPs
claude mcp add github npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
claude mcp add memory npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
claude mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
claude mcp add sequential-thinking npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

### **2. Installer Improvements**
- Remove `2>/dev/null` redirects to see actual error messages
- Add verbose logging option (`./install.sh --verbose`)
- Implement pre-flight checks for NPM package availability
- Add rollback capability if MCP installation fails
- Better error reporting for each installation step

### **3. Testing Improvements**
- Create automated test suite that verifies each MCP server installs
- Test on clean macOS system without pre-existing Claude configuration
- Add validation step that confirms all expected MCPs are working after installation

---

## **🎯 Priority & Impact**

**Business Impact**: High - Users expecting 54 AI agents and 5 MCP servers only get partial functionality  
**User Experience**: Degraded - Missing critical development tools (GitHub integration, memory, filesystem access)  
**Workaround Available**: Yes - Manual MCP installation  
**Fix Complexity**: Medium - Requires debugging installer script and MCP configuration logic

**Next Steps**: Please run diagnostic commands in the development environment and check installation logs to identify the specific failure points in the MCP server installation process.
