## Current Status
- **Date**: 2025-09-08
- **Overall Progress**: 43% (3 of 7 phases complete)
- **Current Phase**: Ready to begin Phase 4 (Database Abstraction & Optimization)

## Completed Phases ✅

### Phase 1: Code Organization & Architecture (100%)
- ✅ Created MVC directory structure (src/Controllers, Models, Repositories, Services)
- ✅ Implemented dependency injection Container
- ✅ Created Database configuration class
- ✅ Built Router system with middleware support
- ✅ Set up Composer autoloading (PSR-4)

### Phase 2: Modern PHP Standards (100%)  
- ✅ Added strict typing declarations throughout
- ✅ Created interfaces (ChildRepositoryInterface, SponsorshipRepositoryInterface, SponsorshipServiceInterface)
- ✅ Implemented modern PHP 8.2+ enums (ChildStatus, SponsorshipStatus, SponsorshipType)
- ✅ Applied constructor property promotion
- ✅ Ensured PSR-12 code standards compliance

### Phase 3: Security & Validation (100%)
- ✅ Implemented CsrfManager for CSRF protection
- ✅ Created RateLimiter for abuse prevention
- ✅ Built ChildValidator with comprehensive validation rules
- ✅ Added security headers in .htaccess
- ✅ Protected sensitive directories

## Next Phase: Phase 4 - Database Abstraction & Optimization

### Key Tasks Remaining:
1. **Query Builder Implementation** - Create flexible query building system
2. **Connection Pooling** - Optimize database connections
3. **Query Result Caching** - Add Redis/Memcached integration
4. **Performance Optimization** - Fix N+1 queries, add indexes
5. **Migration System** - Database schema management

## How to Resume Work

When you return to this project, simply:

1. **Check Progress**: Read `/Users/johncorbin/Desktop/projs/cfk/docs/REFACTOR-PROGRESS.json`
2. **Review Plan**: Reference `/Users/johncorbin/Desktop/projs/cfk/docs/CFK-STANDALONE-REFACTORING-PLAN.md`
3. **Continue Phase 4**: Begin database abstraction and optimization tasks
4. **Update Progress**: Update the JSON tracker as you complete tasks

## Resume Command Example

```
"I need to continue the CFK standalone refactoring. I was at Phase 4 - Database Abstraction & Optimization. Please check the progress files and continue where we left off."
```

## Key Architecture Decisions Made

1. **MVC Pattern**: Clean separation of Controllers, Models, and Views
2. **Dependency Injection**: Interface-based DI with Container class
3. **Modern PHP**: Strict typing, enums, and PHP 8.2+ features
4. **Security First**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation
5. **Professional Standards**: PSR-12 compliant, well-documented

The refactoring has transformed the application from a monolithic structure to a professional, maintainable, and secure system following enterprise-level standards.
