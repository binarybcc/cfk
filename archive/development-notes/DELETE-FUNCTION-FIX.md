# Quick Fix: Delete All Children Function

## Issue
Delete function was using `Database::getInstance()` which doesn't exist in the standalone application.

## Fix Applied
Updated `handleDeleteAllChildren()` function in `/admin/import_csv.php` to use correct static Database methods:

### Before (Broken)
```php
$db = Database::getInstance();
$count = $db->fetchValue("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM children");
$db->execute("DELETE FROM children");
```

### After (Working)
```php
$countResult = Database::fetchRow("SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM children");
$count = $countResult['total'] ?? 0;
Database::execute("DELETE FROM children");
```

## Status
âœ… **Fixed and deployed** to http://localhost:8082/admin/import_csv.php

## Function Now Works
1. Type "DELETE" in confirmation box
2. Click delete button  
3. Confirm in popup
4. All children, families, and sponsorships deleted
