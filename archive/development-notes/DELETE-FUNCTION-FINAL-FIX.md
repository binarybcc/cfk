# Final Fix: Delete All Children Function

## Root Cause Found
The `cfk_sponsorships` table doesn't exist in the database, causing the delete function to fail.

## Database Status
✅ `children` table: Exists (0 records)  
✅ `families` table: Exists (0 records)  
❌ `cfk_sponsorships` table: **Does not exist**

## Fix Applied
Added error handling for missing `cfk_sponsorships` table:

```php
// Delete related sponsorships if table exists
try {
    Database::query("DELETE FROM cfk_sponsorships");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Table might not exist, continue without error
    error_log('cfk_sponsorships table not found during delete: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
```

## Status
✅ **Fixed and deployed** - Delete function now handles missing table gracefully

## Function Now:
1. ✅ Deletes all children records
2. ✅ Deletes all family records  
3. ✅ Attempts to delete sponsorships (skips if table missing)
4. ✅ Returns success message
