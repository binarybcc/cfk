# Next Session Status

## What's New/Changed This Session

### ✅ **NEW FILES CREATED:**
1. **PROJECT-GOALS-AND-PLAN.md** - Complete implementation plan for standalone PHP app
2. **NEXT-SESSION-STATUS.md** - This status file

### ✅ **KEY DECISIONS MADE:**
- **Abandoning WordPress plugin approach** (shortcode never worked)
- **Switching to standalone PHP application** (maintainable by non-coders)
- **Technology stack**: Pure PHP + Modern Frontend (Nexcess compatible)
- **Integration**: Zeffy donation system (script provided in Zeffy.txt)

### ✅ **ANALYZED:**
- Live cforkids.org site functionality (uses WooCommerce - insulting "kids as products")

- Need to replace with dignified child sponsorship system

### ✅ **CLEANED UP:**
- Removed failed WordPress plugin attempts
- Removed temporary Docker files
- Removed incomplete standalone starter file
