- `search_nodes` - Find information by keyword
- `read_graph` - View entire memory
- `open_nodes` - Retrieve specific entities

### Sequential Thinking Tools
- `sequential_thinking` - Step-by-step problem analysis
- Break complex problems into stages:
  - Problem Definition
  - Research
  - Analysis  
  - Synthesis
  - Conclusion

## Restart Required

## Benefits for CFK Refactoring Project

### Memory MCP
- Store architectural decisions and rationale
- Track refactoring progress across sessions
- Build knowledge base of code patterns and solutions
- Remember lessons learned from previous changes

### Sequential Thinking MCP
- Plan refactoring steps systematically
- Analyze current vs desired architecture
- Document decision-making processes
- Break down complex problems methodically

## Verification

After restart, you can verify the installation by asking Claude to:
1. "Use memory to store information about our CFK project"
2. "Use sequential thinking to analyze the refactoring approach"

The tools should appear in Claude's available functions.
